Reimplementing containers in C every time is tedious, so I'm developing these pure C, copy-and-paste-ready containers. The source code is well-tested and provides easy-to-use C APIs for interacting with the containers.

There are no external dependencies—simply copy the source of any container and paste it directly into your code. The header files are completely self-contained, so you only need to include what you use—nothing more. Thread-safe variants are also available.

If you need a specific feature added, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
