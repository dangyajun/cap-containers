## "Copy-And-Paste" ready pure C containers

Reimplementing containers everytime in C is a pain, I was frustrated myself trying to reimplement the same containers over and over in C, so I am writing this pure C ***Copy and Paste*** ready containers.

There is **no** external dependencies needed, You can just copy the source of any of the containers and paste it directly into the source code where you need. Headers files are completly self-contained, You just need to grab what you want, nothing more.
