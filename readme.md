Reimplementing containers everytime in C is a pain, I was frustrated myself trying to reimplement the same containers over and over in C, so I am writing this pure C ***Copy and Paste*** ready containers. The source code is well tested with easy to use with C APIs to interact with the containers.

There is ***zero*** external dependencies needed, You can just copy the source of any of the containers and paste it directly into the source code where you need. Headers files are completely **self-contained**, You just need to *grab what you want, nothing more.* <br>
If you specifically need a feature to be added, please create an "Issue" ticket or feel free to send a PR. <br>
